# ðŸš€ Excited to share my new project - an interactive Sms (spam or ham) Classifier
Our SMS Classifier project harnesses the power of Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to identify whether a given SMS message is spam or not. Deployed as a user-friendly app on Streamlit Cloud, users can simply input a message, and our system swiftly determines its nature, either labeling it as spam or not spam.

Using the Naive Bayes algorithm, our model boasts an impressive accuracy rate of 97% and a precision score of 1, ensuring reliable and accurate classifications. Naive Bayes is particularly effective in text classification tasks due to its simplicity and efficiency in handling high-dimensional data like text
